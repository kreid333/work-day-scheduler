# Work Day Scheduler


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a work day planner, spanning from the hours 9AM - 5PM, that saved information inputted by the user and also had text fields that were color coded depending on if they were past hours, future hours, or the current hour.

## Usage 

In order to access this application, the user can click on the link below, which will redirect them to my Work Day Scheduler application.

* [Work Day Scheduler](https://kreid333.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)

From there, the user can type in anything they please into the text fields. That information inputted into the text field will be saved and after a refresh, will still be present on the page. Additionally, past, present, and future hours are color coded, making reading the scheduler much easier to read.
